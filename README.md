# Minikube Quickstart
A collection of bash scripts and Ansible playbooks to get a simple minikube deployment working.


## Usage
If not using localhost, update the local ./hosts file including variables defined there.

Run `setup-local-minikube.sh` to setup dependencies and run playbooks.


## Requirements
None. Will setup Ansible, Docker and Minikube after running the bash script.


## Note
Only tested on CentOS 7. Might not fully work on other distros.
